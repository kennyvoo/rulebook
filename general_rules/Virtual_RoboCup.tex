\section{Camera Setup} \label{sec:CameraSetup}

Since the referees are not present at the arena during the Virtual RoboCup, the arena and all activities of the robot must be shown via livestream. For this purpose, cameras must be able to monitor the entire arena for the referees and the cameras should be mounted at least at head height. No blind spots are allowed when streaming the arena so that the referees can see and evaluate every activity of the robot. One or more cameras can be used to stream the arena. Please contact the OC for the maximum number of streams available.
\par
In addition to the cameras for the arena, there must be a person who follows the robot with a mobile camera and shows the robot's activities from close up. This allows the referees to detect even small mistakes. The person is allowed to enter the arena during the run. However, the person is not allowed to interact with the robot.
\par
A camera can also be attached to the robot to better show the robot's activities to the referees and spectators. The camera on the robot is optional.
